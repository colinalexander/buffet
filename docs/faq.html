          MandateOS is a mandate-bound judgment system. It produces auditable,
          append-only Judgment Records and may escalate to human authority; it
          never places trades.
        </p>
        <p class="preamble">
          The questions below address common governance, risk, and control concerns raised by non-engineers.
        </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>1) Is MandateOS a trading system?</h3>
          <p>
            No. MandateOS is a governance and judgment system that produces
            records describing an outcome: affirm alignment, recommend an
            exposure-level adjustment, or escalate. It does not route orders or
            place trades.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>2) Does MandateOS place trades or mutate portfolios?</h3>
          <p>
            No. The system outputs read-only artifacts (Judgment Records and
            escalation artifacts) and does not mutate portfolio state. Any
            portfolio changes occur only through human-controlled processes
            outside this repository.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>3) Does MandateOS make investment decisions?</h3>
          <p>
            MandateOS does not decide what to do with capital; it applies
            documented procedures under an explicit mandate to produce a
            judgment outcome and rationale. It may recommend exposure-level
            adjustments within authority bounds, or escalate when authority or
            confidence limits are reached. Final accountability and
            authorization remain with human fiduciaries.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>4) Does the system learn over time?</h3>
          <p>
            Not autonomously. Institutional learning occurs through human review
            and versioned updates to mandates and procedures. The system does
            not perform trial-and-error learning or adapt its authority at
            runtime.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>5) Is reinforcement learning used?</h3>
          <p>
            No. Reinforcement learning and reward optimization are outside the
            authority model. The system is designed for determinism, audit, and
            escalation discipline rather than self-optimization.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item escalate">
          <h3>6) What triggers escalation?</h3>
          <p>
            Escalation is triggered when predefined authority boundaries are
            reached: hard constraint breaches, confidence falling below mandate
            minimums, conflicting objectives, or persistent uncertainty beyond
            procedural tolerance. Escalation is a designed outcome, not an error
            condition.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>7) What happens after escalation?</h3>
          <p>
            The system produces an escalation artifact that routes the issue to
            human authority. Automated judgment does not proceed as if the
            decision were resolved; escalation indicates human review is
            required to authorize any next step.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>8) Can mandates or procedures be changed through the UI?</h3>
          <p>
            No. The Judgment Viewer is a read-only, non-authoritative viewer of
            published artifacts. It does not provide controls to modify
            mandates, procedures, or records.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>9) How is past behavior audited and reproduced?</h3>
          <p>
            Each Judgment Record binds to the mandate and procedure versions
            used at the time of judgment, and records are append-only for audit.
            Auditing is performed by reviewing the referenced authority sources
            and the emitted record. Reproducing exact outputs additionally
            depends on the runtime engine version used to run the procedure.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>10) Who is accountable for outcomes?</h3>
          <p>
            Human fiduciaries remain accountable for mandates, procedure
            governance, and any actions taken in response to judgments or
            escalations. The system is designed to make authority explicit and
            decisions auditable, not to replace fiduciary responsibility.
