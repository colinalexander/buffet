# Cross-Skill Conflict Resolution Policy (non-authoritative, minimal v1)
#
# This file is a machine-readable policy describing escalation-first handling of
# cross-skill conflicts. It MUST NOT introduce new authority or precedence rules.
#
# When uncertain, defer to canonical authority sources and escalate on conflict:
# - `documentation/JUDGMENT_AUTHORITY.md`
# - `documentation/PROCEDURE_CONTRACT.md`
# - `documentation/JUDGMENT_RECORD_SCHEMA.md`
# - `mandates/**/mandate.yaml`
# - `judgment_loops/**/procedure.md`
#
# Existing runtime record locations (append-only):
# - Judgment Records: `data/processed/judgment_records/`
# - Escalation stubs: `data/processed/escalations/`
# - Override artifacts: `data/processed/overrides/` (see `governance/override_log.md`)

conflict_definition:
  description: >
    A conflict exists when two or more skill assessments yield incompatible
    dispositions (e.g., one skill indicates "do not proceed"/veto/inaction while
    another indicates proceeding), and the conflict cannot be resolved by the
    governing mandate and binding procedure without introducing discretionary
    precedence not already defined in canonical authority.
