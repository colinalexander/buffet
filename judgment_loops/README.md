# Judgment Loops

Judgment loops define binding procedural logic under mandates.

## History Policy

- `history/` is a human-readable changelog for a loop.
- Git remains authoritative for exact diffs.
- Each entry must reference a PR or commit hash (placeholder allowed).
- Entries must describe:
  - What changed
  - Why
  - Expected behavioral delta
  - Scenarios / eval cases affected
  - Risk / rollback notes
