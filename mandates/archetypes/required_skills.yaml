# Default archetype → skills mapping (non-authoritative)
#
# This file provides orchestration defaults keyed by `meta.archetype` in
# `mandates/**/mandate.yaml`.
#
# Canonical authority remains:
# - `documentation/**` (authority contracts)
# - `mandates/**/mandate.yaml` (constraints and boundaries)
# - `judgment_loops/**/procedure.md` (binding procedural logic)
#
# Do not treat this mapping as a source of authority. When in doubt, defer to the
# governing mandate/procedure and escalate on conflict.
