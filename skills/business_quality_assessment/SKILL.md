# SKILL: Business Quality Assessment

## Summary
Business Quality Assessment is the skill of determining whether a business possesses
durable economic characteristics that enable reliable long-term value creation.
It focuses on *what the business is*, not how it is priced, and establishes whether
the enterprise is suitable for capital commitment at all.

This skill precedes valuation and acts as a primary admissibility filter for investment
judgment.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **gatekeeping constraint** in the investment decision loop.

It determines whether a candidate business is:
- admissible for further analysis,
- admissible only under restrictive assumptions, or
- inadmissible regardless of price.

Failure at this stage halts downstream judgment unless explicitly escalated.

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Business Durability Gate
**Purpose:**  
Assess whether the business can sustain its economic function and relevance
over the mandate horizon.

**Key Questions:**
- What core customer problem does the business solve?
- Why does this business continue to exist in its current form?
- What specific forces could erode its position over time?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Business model description
- Industry structure overview
- Historical persistence of demand

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record: affirm_alignment | recommend_adjustment | escalate
- Rationale describing durability drivers and threats

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Narrative-driven enthusiasm
- Confusion between growth and durability

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Durability depends primarily on continued excellence or favorable conditions

---

### Checkpoint 2: Economic Simplicity Test
**Purpose:**  
Ensure the business economics are understandable, explainable, and monitorable.

**Key Questions:**
- Can the source of profits be explained end-to-end in plain language?
- Are margins and returns driven by structural factors or transient conditions?
- Can ongoing performance be monitored without complex proxies?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Simplified income and cash flow drivers
- Explanation of cost and pricing power

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record with explanation of economic clarity

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Hidden leverage
- Complexity obscuring risk

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Economics cannot be articulated without layered assumptions

---

### Checkpoint 3: Competitive Position Verification
**Purpose:**  
Determine whether the business holds a defensible position relative to competitors.

**Key Questions:**
- What prevents competitors from replicating this business?
- Is advantage structural, contractual, regulatory, or behavioral?
- How has the competitive position changed historically?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Historical ROIC vs peers

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record with identified advantage sources

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Temporary advantage mistaken for moat
- Brand or scale over-attribution

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Advantage depends on continuous aggressive behavior to sustain

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority to affirm, adjust, or reject.
- **Models:** Advisory only; may summarize evidence and flag concerns.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not independently admit a business past this skill.

This skill explicitly may NOT decide valuation, timing, or position sizing.

---

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: 10+ years
- Secondary horizon: Full business cycle

Judgments should degrade slowly and change only with structural evidence.

## Interaction With Other Skills

**Upstream (inputs from):**
- None (this is an entry-point skill)

**Downstream (feeds into):**
- intrinsic_value_estimation
- margin_of_safety_enforcement
- structural_advantage_identification

---

## Auditability & Records
- Judgment Records stored as append-only assessments
- Required narrative rationale (no numeric-only approvals)
- Review cadence: upon major business model or industry change
- Records retained indefinitely

---

## Common Misuse Patterns
- Confusing rapid growth with quality
- Treating managerial brilliance as a substitute for structure
- Allowing valuation attractiveness to override quality concerns

## Notes
A business that fails this skill cannot be rescued by valuation alone without
explicit escalation and documented rationale.
