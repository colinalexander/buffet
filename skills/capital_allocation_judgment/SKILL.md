# SKILL: Capital Allocation Judgment

## Summary
Capital Allocation Judgment is the skill of deciding how incremental capital should
be deployed to maximize long-term per-unit value creation. It treats capital as
scarce, reversible only at cost, and always subject to opportunity cost.

This skill governs *where capital goes*, not whether a business is good.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **comparative decision layer**.

It determines whether allocating capital to a given opportunity is superior to:
- alternative investments,
- internal reinvestment,
- capital return,
- or holding cash.

This skill explicitly forces trade-offs; no allocation is evaluated in isolation.

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Incremental Return Comparator
**Purpose:**  
Ensure capital is allocated to its highest long-term use.

**Key Questions:**
- What is the expected long-term return on incremental capital here?
- What is the next-best alternative use of this capital?
- How sensitive is the comparison to assumptions?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Expected return narratives (not point forecasts)
- Alternative allocation options

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record comparing allocation options
- Explicit opportunity cost rationale

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Absolute-return thinking
- Ignoring internal alternatives

**Escalation Criteria:**
- No credible comparison to alternatives

---

### Checkpoint 2: Reinvestment Quality Assessment
**Purpose:**  
Evaluate whether the recipient of capital can deploy it effectively.

**Key Questions:**
- Has incremental capital historically produced attractive returns?
- Are reinvestment opportunities repeatable or diminishing?
- Does scale impair reinvestment quality?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Historical incremental ROIC
- Reinvestment track record

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record on reinvestment effectiveness

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Growth for growth’s sake
- Capital absorption bias

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Evidence of declining marginal returns

---

### Checkpoint 3: Capital Flexibility Review
**Purpose:**  
Assess reversibility and optionality of the allocation.

**Key Questions:**
- Can capital be reallocated if conditions change?
- What is the cost of being wrong?
- Does this allocation constrain future decisions?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Liquidity and exit considerations
- Commitment duration assessment

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record addressing flexibility and lock-in risk

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Irreversible commitments without compensation
- Hidden long-term constraints

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Allocation materially limits future optionality

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority to approve allocations.
- **Models:** Advisory only; may surface comparisons and constraints.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not optimize allocation autonomously.

This skill may NOT override margin of safety requirements.

---

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: Multi-year to permanent
- Secondary horizon: Capital redeployment cycle

Capital allocation decisions should age slowly and change only with evidence.

## Interaction With Other Skills

**Upstream (inputs from):**
- margin_of_safety_enforcement
- intrinsic_value_estimation
- opportunity_cost_awareness

**Downstream (feeds into):**
- patience_as_active_strategy
- scale_aware_decision_making
- institutional_constraint_awareness

---

## Auditability & Records
- Allocation decisions recorded with explicit alternatives considered
- Re-evaluated upon major capital changes
- Post-allocation reviews required
- Records retained permanently

---

## Common Misuse Patterns
- Treating cash as a drag rather than an option
- Confusing activity with progress
- Allocating to justify prior analysis

## Notes
Capital allocation is the ultimate expression of judgment.
Every dollar deployed is a decision not to deploy it elsewhere.
