# SKILL: Circle of Competence Enforcement

## Summary
Circle of Competence Enforcement is the skill of constraining judgment to domains
where causal understanding is sufficient to support confident, durable decisions.
It prioritizes knowability over cleverness and explicitly treats acknowledged
ignorance as a strength rather than a weakness.

This skill defines what the system is permitted to judge.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **domain admissibility constraint**.

It determines whether a business, industry, or situation falls within the
system’s knowable boundaries. Opportunities outside this boundary are excluded
unless explicitly escalated with justification.

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Causal Comprehensibility Test
**Purpose:**  
Ensure the business can be understood end-to-end without reliance on opaque models
or second-order speculation.

**Key Questions:**
- Can causal drivers be explained in plain language?
- What must be true for this business to succeed?
- Where does understanding break down?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Written causal explanation
- Identification of unknowns

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record affirming or rejecting comprehensibility

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Mistaking familiarity for understanding
- Outsourcing understanding to experts

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Core drivers cannot be explained clearly

---

### Checkpoint 2: Boundary Honesty Assessment
**Purpose:**  
Force explicit acknowledgment of what is not understood.

**Key Questions:**
- Which variables are outside our understanding?
- Are unknowns central or peripheral?
- Are we compensating appropriately for ignorance?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Explicit unknowns list
- Risk mitigation strategies

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record documenting boundaries and unknowns

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Hidden ignorance
- Overconfidence

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Unknowns dominate outcome distribution

---

### Checkpoint 3: Monitoring Capability Verification
**Purpose:**  
Ensure the business can be monitored for degradation of assumptions.

**Key Questions:**
- What indicators signal deterioration?
- Are indicators observable and timely?
- Can changes be detected before damage is irreversible?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Monitoring metrics and triggers
- Historical early-warning signals

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record affirming monitorability

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Blind spots
- Delayed reaction risk

**Escalation Criteria:**
- No reliable way to monitor key assumptions

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority to define competence boundaries.
- **Models:** Advisory only; may summarize known vs unknown factors.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not expand the circle autonomously.

This skill may veto opportunities regardless of valuation or attractiveness.

---

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: Persistent
- Secondary horizon: Reassessed upon learning or structural change

Circle boundaries should expand slowly and contract quickly.

---

## Auditability & Records
- Circle definitions documented explicitly
- Boundary changes require justification
- Escalations reviewed by senior authority
- Records retained permanently

---

## Common Misuse Patterns
- Equating expertise access with understanding
- Expanding the circle under performance pressure
- Using complexity as justification

## Notes
Knowing what you do not understand is a competitive advantage.
This skill institutionalizes that insight.
