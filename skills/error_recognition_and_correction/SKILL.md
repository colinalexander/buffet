# SKILL: Error Recognition and Correction

## Summary
Error Recognition and Correction is the skill of identifying when a judgment,
assumption, or decision is wrong, and responding by updating beliefs and actions
promptly and proportionately. It institutionalizes intellectual honesty and treats
learning as a core risk-control mechanism.

This skill ensures the system adapts without ego or defensiveness.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **self-correction mechanism**.

It governs how the system responds to disconfirming evidence, preventing small
mistakes from compounding into large losses and ensuring that learning occurs
symmetrically for successes and failures.

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Disconfirming Evidence Scan
**Purpose:**  
Ensure that evidence contradicting prior judgments is actively sought and evaluated.

**Key Questions:**
- What evidence would prove this judgment wrong?
- Has such evidence emerged?
- Are signals being dismissed or rationalized?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Updated performance data
- New qualitative or structural information

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record documenting evidence assessment

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Confirmation bias
- Narrative entrenchment

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Disconfirming evidence is repeatedly ignored

---

### Checkpoint 2: Error Attribution Analysis
**Purpose:**  
Distinguish between bad outcomes due to error and those due to randomness.

**Key Questions:**
- Was the original reasoning flawed?
- Did assumptions fail, or did outcomes vary within expectations?
- Would the decision be repeated under similar conditions?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Original judgment records
- Outcome vs expectation comparison

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record identifying error sources

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Outcome bias
- Blaming randomness selectively

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Inability to articulate why an outcome occurred

---

### Checkpoint 3: Corrective Action Discipline
**Purpose:**  
Ensure that recognized errors lead to appropriate action.

**Key Questions:**
- What adjustment is warranted?
- Is the response proportional to the error?
- Does correction improve future decisions?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Proposed corrective actions
- Impact assessment

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record recommending adjustment, escalation, or exit

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Overcorrection
- Inertia after recognition

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Errors acknowledged without corrective action

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority; judgment-intensive.
- **Models:** Advisory only; may surface anomalies and inconsistencies.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not enforce corrections autonomously.

This skill may override prior decisions without stigma.

---

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: Continuous
- Secondary horizon: Post-decision review cycles

Error recognition should occur promptly but calmly.

---

## Auditability & Records
- Errors and corrections recorded explicitly
- Rationales preserved for learning
- Periodic review of repeated errors
- Records retained permanently

---

## Common Misuse Patterns
- Admitting errors verbally but not behaviorally
- Overreacting to short-term noise
- Treating learning as retrospective only

## Notes
The cost of being wrong is not the mistake itself,
but the refusal to recognize and correct it.
