# SKILL: Governance and Trust Evaluation

## Summary
Governance and Trust Evaluation is the skill of assessing whether the individuals and
institutions entrusted with capital act with integrity, transparency, and a durable
sense of stewardship. It treats trust as an earned, observable property rooted in
behavior over time, not reputation or credentials.

This skill recognizes that governance failures can destroy value even in strong
businesses.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **stewardship integrity constraint**.

It determines whether the governance environment surrounding an investment supports
long-term owner interests, and whether decision-making authority can be exercised
safely within that environment.

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Integrity Track Record Review
**Purpose:**  
Evaluate historical evidence of ethical behavior and accountability.

**Key Questions:**
- How have past mistakes been acknowledged and addressed?
- Are disclosures candid, consistent, and timely?
- Is bad news communicated as readily as good news?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Historical communications
- Restatements, corrections, or controversies
- Responses to prior adverse events

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record assessing integrity consistency

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Reputation laundering
- Selective disclosure

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Pattern of obfuscation or blame-shifting

---

### Checkpoint 2: Governance Structure Assessment
**Purpose:**  
Assess whether formal governance mechanisms protect owner interests.

**Key Questions:**
- Are boards independent and effective?
- Are checks and balances meaningful?
- Is authority concentrated without oversight?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Governance structure documentation
- Board composition and tenure
- Voting and control arrangements

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record evaluating governance robustness

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Rubber-stamp boards
- Entrenched control

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Structural governance deficiencies

---

### Checkpoint 3: Trust Dependency Evaluation
**Purpose:**  
Determine how much outcomes depend on trust versus structure.

**Key Questions:**
- Does success require exceptional trust in individuals?
- Are safeguards in place if trust erodes?
- Is the system resilient to personnel change?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Succession planning
- Institutionalization of processes

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record assessing trust concentration risk

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Key-person dependency
- Charismatic authority bias

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Excessive reliance on individual integrity without safeguards

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority; judgment-heavy and contextual.
- **Models:** Advisory only; may summarize governance structures and history.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not certify trustworthiness.

This skill may override attractive economics if governance risk is high.

---

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: Multi-decade
- Secondary horizon: Leadership tenure

Governance judgments should change slowly and only with evidence.

but poor governance guarantees eventual failure.
