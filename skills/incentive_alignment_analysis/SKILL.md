# SKILL: Incentive Alignment Analysis

## Summary
Incentive Alignment Analysis is the skill of evaluating whether the motivations,
rewards, and constraints facing decision-makers are aligned with long-term
per-unit value creation. It treats incentives as structural forces that shape
behavior over time, often more reliably than stated intentions or reputations.

This skill ensures that capital is entrusted to stewards whose interests run
parallel to those of long-term owners.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **behavioral risk control**.

It does not assess competence or intelligence, but determines whether the system
of incentives encourages decisions that are beneficial—or harmful—to owners
over the mandate horizon.

Misalignment here can invalidate otherwise attractive opportunities.

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Economic Alignment Test
**Purpose:**  
Assess whether decision-makers benefit in the same way and timeframe as owners.

**Key Questions:**
- How do decision-makers make or lose money personally?
- Is compensation tied to per-share value or aggregate metrics?
- Over what horizon are rewards realized?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Compensation structure details
- Ownership and equity participation
- Vesting and clawback terms

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record describing alignment strength and gaps

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Short-termism
- Size-over-value incentives

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Compensation rewards behavior that harms long-term owners

---

### Checkpoint 2: Incentive-Induced Behavior Scan
**Purpose:**  
Identify behaviors the incentive system is likely to produce, intentionally or not.

**Key Questions:**
- What actions are being encouraged?
- What actions are being discouraged?
- What risks are being externalized?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Historical behavior under similar incentives
- Peer compensation comparisons

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record outlining likely behavioral patterns

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Metric gaming
- Risk transfer to stakeholders

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Incentives promote excessive risk-taking or dilution

---

### Checkpoint 3: Stewardship Signal Review
**Purpose:**  
Evaluate qualitative signals of stewardship beyond formal incentives.

**Key Questions:**
- How are capital allocation decisions explained?
- How are mistakes acknowledged?
- Is communication candid and consistent?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Shareholder communications
- Capital allocation history
- Related-party transactions

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record assessing stewardship credibility

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Charisma bias
- Overreliance on stated values

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Repeated behavior inconsistent with owner interests

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority; judgment-heavy and contextual.
- **Models:** Advisory only; may flag misalignments and summarize structures.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not approve alignment independently.

This skill may override valuation attractiveness if misalignment is severe.

---

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: Full tenure of decision-makers
- Secondary horizon: Incentive cycle and vesting periods

Incentive judgments should change only with structural modifications.

## Auditability & Records
- Incentive structures documented explicitly
- Changes tracked over time
- Behavioral outcomes reviewed periodically
- Records retained permanently

---

## Common Misuse Patterns
- Assuming good people negate bad incentives
- Overweighting equity ownership without context
- Ignoring scale-driven incentive distortion

## Notes
Incentives do not determine outcomes, but they heavily influence the distribution
of outcomes. Ignoring them is a governance failure.
