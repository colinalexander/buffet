# SKILL: Institutional Constraint Awareness

## Summary
Institutional Constraint Awareness is the skill of ensuring that all investment
judgments are compatible with the legal, fiduciary, liquidity, tax, governance,
and mandate constraints under which capital is managed. It grounds theoretical
attractiveness in real-world feasibility and enforceability.

This skill ensures that good ideas do not become bad decisions through constraint
violations.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **mandate compatibility and feasibility gate**.

It determines whether a decision that is otherwise attractive can be executed,
held, governed, and exited within institutional boundaries without introducing
unacceptable risk or breach.

---

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Mandate Compatibility Review
**Purpose:**  
Ensure alignment with explicit investment mandates and fiduciary duties.

**Key Questions:**
- Is this decision permitted under the mandate?
- Does it align with fiduciary obligations?
- Are any constraints being stretched or reinterpreted?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Mandate documentation
- Fiduciary standards

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record affirming or rejecting mandate compatibility

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Mandate drift
- Rationalized exceptions

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Decision requires reinterpretation of mandate language

---

### Checkpoint 2: Liquidity and Horizon Alignment
**Purpose:**  
Assess whether liquidity characteristics match institutional needs.

**Key Questions:**
- Can capital be held through stress?
- Do liquidity needs force premature action?
- Is liquidity optional or required?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Liquidity profile analysis
- Cash flow obligations

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record evaluating liquidity alignment

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Forced selling
- Maturity mismatches

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Liquidity risk conflicts with obligations

---

### Checkpoint 3: Governance and Operational Feasibility
**Purpose:**  
Ensure the institution can govern and oversee the decision effectively.

**Key Questions:**
- Are reporting and oversight requirements met?
- Can risks be monitored and controlled?
- Does complexity exceed institutional capacity?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Governance processes
- Operational capabilities

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record assessing feasibility

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Governance overload
- Operational blind spots

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Decision exceeds governance or operational capacity

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority; institutional judgment required.
- **Models:** Advisory only; may flag constraint conflicts.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not waive institutional constraints.

This skill may veto decisions regardless of economic attractiveness.

---

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: Institutional lifecycle
- Secondary horizon: Obligation and reporting cycles

Constraint assessments must remain current as obligations evolve.

**Downstream (feeds into):**

---

## Auditability & Records
- Constraint assessments documented explicitly
- Mandate interpretations recorded
- Reviewed upon mandate or obligation changes
- Records retained permanently

---

## Common Misuse Patterns
- Treating constraints as negotiable
- Assuming flexibility without evidence
- Ignoring downstream governance burden

## Notes
Institutions fail not because ideas are bad,
but because constraints are ignored.
This skill ensures judgment remains grounded in reality.
