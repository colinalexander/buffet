# SKILL: Intrinsic Value Estimation

## Summary
Intrinsic Value Estimation is the skill of forming a conservative, owner-oriented
assessment of what a business is worth based on its long-term capacity to generate
distributable cash flows. It explicitly rejects market price as a signal of value
and treats valuation as an exercise in judgment under uncertainty, not precision.

This skill produces a *value range*, not a point estimate.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **calibration and bounding mechanism** in the decision loop.

It does not decide whether to invest, but establishes:
- what must be true for value to be realized,
- how sensitive value is to assumptions,
- and whether price can later be evaluated against value.

Downstream skills may not override this assessment without escalation.

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Owner Earnings Integrity Check
**Purpose:**  
Ensure that value estimation is grounded in true economic earnings rather than
reported accounting results.

**Key Questions:**
- What cash is genuinely available to owners over time?
- What level of reinvestment is required to sustain the business?
- Which earnings components are non-recurring or illusory?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Historical cash flow statements
- Maintenance vs growth capex assessment
- Normalization assumptions

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record with defined owner-earnings range
- Explicit exclusions and adjustments

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Reliance on GAAP earnings alone
- Capitalizing cyclical peaks

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Owner earnings cannot be reasonably estimated

---

### Checkpoint 2: Assumption Transparency Test
**Purpose:**  
Force explicit articulation of assumptions driving intrinsic value.

**Key Questions:**
- Which assumptions matter most to value?
- Are assumptions structural or forecast-driven?
- How fragile is value to small changes?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Written valuation assumptions
- Sensitivity analysis (qualitative or quantitative)

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record listing key assumptions and sensitivities

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Hidden optimism
- Implicit growth assumptions

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Value depends on narrow or heroic assumptions

---

### Checkpoint 3: Valuation Range Discipline
**Purpose:**  
Prevent false precision and encourage humility in valuation.

**Key Questions:**
- What is a conservative low-end value?
- What would justify the high-end value?
- Where does uncertainty dominate estimation?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Value range construction
- Narrative explanation of bounds

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record specifying a valuation range
- Confidence level commentary

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Single-number fixation
- Overconfidence in models

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Inability to define a credible lower bound

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority to approve valuation ranges.
- **Models:** May generate scenarios, sensitivities, and summaries; advisory only.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not set final valuation bounds without human sign-off.

This skill may NOT determine purchase decisions or sizing.

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: 5–15 years
- Secondary horizon: Business lifetime

Short-term fluctuations are explicitly excluded from consideration.

**Downstream (feeds into):**

- capital_allocation_judgment
- owner_mindset_reasoning

---

## Auditability & Records
- All valuation judgments recorded with assumptions and ranges
- No approval without written rationale
- Revisions must reference changed assumptions or evidence
- Retained as permanent Judgment Records

---

## Common Misuse Patterns
- Treating valuation models as truth engines
- Anchoring on recent prices
- Allowing growth narratives to substitute for cash flow analysis

## Notes
Intrinsic value is an estimate, not a fact. Precision is not accuracy.
The purpose of this skill is disciplined reasoning, not numerical elegance.
