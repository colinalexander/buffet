# SKILL: Long-Horizon Compounding Orientation

## Summary
Long-Horizon Compounding Orientation is the skill of evaluating decisions based on
their ability to increase per-unit value over extended periods of time. It prioritizes
durability, reinvestment capacity, and cumulative effects over short-term performance,
reporting outcomes, or market reactions.

This skill anchors judgment in decades rather than quarters.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **temporal alignment constraint**.

It ensures that investment decisions are evaluated primarily on their long-term
compounding consequences, and that near-term metrics do not distort judgment or
override durable value creation.

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Compounding Pathway Identification
**Purpose:**  
Identify how value compounds over time if the decision is correct.

**Key Questions:**
- What exactly compounds: earnings, cash flows, competitive position, or optionality?
- Is compounding linear, accelerating, or self-limiting?
- What breaks the compounding process?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Reinvestment pathways
- Historical compounding evidence

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record describing compounding mechanisms

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Confusing growth with compounding
- Assuming persistence without cause

**Escalation Criteria:**
- No clear mechanism for long-term compounding

---

### Checkpoint 2: Time Arbitrage Validation
**Purpose:**  
Ensure the decision benefits from patience rather than speed.

**Key Questions:**
- Does value accrue with time independent of market recognition?
- Are short-term underperformance risks acceptable?
- Is patience being rewarded structurally?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Time-based value drivers
- Historical lag between value creation and recognition

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record affirming or rejecting time arbitrage

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Performance-chasing
- Short-horizon pressure

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Thesis requires rapid validation or market approval

---

### Checkpoint 3: Compounding Integrity Stress Test
**Purpose:**  
Test whether compounding survives adverse or stagnant environments.

**Key Questions:**
- How does the compounding engine behave in flat or hostile conditions?
- Can value still accrue without growth?
- Does compounding reverse under stress?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Down-cycle performance analysis
- Stress narratives

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record evaluating compounding resilience

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Cyclicality misclassified as compounding
- Fragile growth dependence

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Compounding collapses outside favorable regimes

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority; requires qualitative judgment.
- **Models:** Advisory only; may project scenarios but not validate durability.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not certify compounding durability.

This skill may override attractive short-term opportunities.

---

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: 10–30 years
- Secondary horizon: Multiple business cycles

Judgment should remain stable across market regimes.
