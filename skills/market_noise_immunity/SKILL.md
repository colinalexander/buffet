# SKILL: Market Noise Immunity

## Summary
Market Noise Immunity is the skill of distinguishing information that alters intrinsic
value from information that merely reflects market sentiment, price movement, or
narrative shifts. It prevents reactive decision-making and ensures that judgment
remains anchored to fundamentals rather than fluctuations.

This skill enforces emotional and informational discipline.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **signal-filtering constraint**.

It determines whether new information warrants a change in judgment or should be
explicitly ignored. It protects long-horizon decisions from short-term disturbances.

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Value-Relevance Filter
**Purpose:**  
Determine whether new information affects intrinsic value.

**Key Questions:**
- Has the long-term earning power changed?
- Does the information alter business durability or economics?
- Is this information transient or structural?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Description of new information
- Linkage to intrinsic value drivers

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record affirming relevance or irrelevance

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Price movement as information
- Narrative amplification

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Unclear linkage between information and value

---

### Checkpoint 2: Sentiment vs Signal Discrimination
**Purpose:**  
Separate market psychology from fundamental change.

**Key Questions:**
- Is this information widely known or newly discovered?
- Is the reaction disproportionate to substance?
- Would this matter if markets were closed?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Market reaction context
- Historical analogs

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record classifying information as signal or noise

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Herd behavior
- Overreaction

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Difficulty disentangling sentiment from fundamentals

---

### Checkpoint 3: Response Discipline Gate
**Purpose:**  
Prevent unnecessary action in response to noise.

**Key Questions:**
- Does this warrant action now?
- What is the cost of doing nothing?
- Does patience improve outcomes?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Action vs inaction analysis
- Time horizon considerations

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record affirming action or deliberate inaction

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Emotional trading
- News-driven activity

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Pressure to act without value-based justification

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority to classify information.
- **Models:** Advisory only; may summarize news and flag changes.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not trigger trades or reallocations.

This skill may delay responses even to material information pending verification.

---

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: Ongoing
- Secondary horizon: Event-driven reassessment

Noise immunity must operate continuously.

## Notes
Markets are information-processing machines, but not all information
is worth processing for long-term judgment.
