# SKILL: Opportunity Cost Awareness

## Summary
Opportunity Cost Awareness is the skill of evaluating every decision relative to the
best available alternative use of capital, time, and attention. It treats capital as
scarce and recognizes that choosing one path necessarily forgoes others, including
the option to do nothing.

This skill prevents isolated decision-making and enforces comparative judgment.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **relative evaluation constraint**.

It ensures that no investment, hold, or action is approved without explicit
comparison to realistic alternatives, including retaining flexibility.

---

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Alternative Set Identification
**Purpose:**  
Force explicit enumeration of credible alternatives.

**Key Questions:**
- What are the realistic alternative uses of this capital?
- Is holding cash a viable option?
- Are internal opportunities being overlooked?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- List of alternative allocations
- Capital availability context

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record listing evaluated alternatives

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- False dichotomies
- Framing bias

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Alternatives are dismissed without analysis

---

### Checkpoint 2: Relative Attractiveness Comparison
**Purpose:**  
Assess the opportunity relative to alternatives on a common basis.

**Key Questions:**
- Why is this superior to the next-best option?
- What are we giving up by choosing this?
- Are differences material or marginal?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Comparative narratives
- Risk and return trade-off discussion

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record articulating comparative advantage

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Absolute-return fixation
- Anchoring on sunk analysis

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Superiority cannot be articulated clearly

---

### Checkpoint 3: Inaction Justification Test
**Purpose:**  
Ensure that action bias does not override discipline.

**Key Questions:**
- Is inaction preferable at this time?
- What improves by waiting?
- What decays by waiting?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Time-based considerations
- Market and internal conditions

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record affirming action or deliberate inaction

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Activity bias
- Fear of missing out

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Action justified primarily by discomfort with inactivity

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority to weigh alternatives.
- **Models:** Advisory only; may surface alternatives and comparisons.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not force ranking-based decisions.

This skill may delay or veto action without rejecting the underlying thesis.

---

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: Allocation decision horizon
- Secondary horizon: Capital recycling cycle

Opportunity cost should be reassessed whenever conditions change materially.

**Downstream (feeds into):**
- patience_as_active_strategy
- market_noise_immunity

---

## Auditability & Records
- Alternatives explicitly recorded
- Inaction decisions documented and revisited
- Post-decision reviews assess foregone outcomes
- Records retained permanently

---

## Common Misuse Patterns
- Treating analysis effort as justification
- Comparing against straw-man alternatives
- Ignoring the value of optionality

## Notes
The cost of a decision is not measured only by what happens next,
but by what could have happened instead.
