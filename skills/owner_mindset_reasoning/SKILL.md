# SKILL: Owner-Mindset Reasoning

## Summary
Owner-Mindset Reasoning is the skill of evaluating decisions as if owning 100% of the
business indefinitely, rather than holding a tradable security. It reframes judgment
around long-term stewardship, cash generation, and intrinsic value rather than
liquidity, market pricing, or exit timing.

This skill suppresses trading instincts in favor of ownership discipline.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **framing and perspective constraint**.

It ensures that decisions are evaluated through the lens of permanent ownership,
forcing alignment with long-term value creation and discouraging short-term,
price-driven behavior.

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Full-Ownership Test
**Purpose:**  
Reframe the opportunity as a private, permanent ownership decision.

**Key Questions:**
- Would we buy the entire business at this price?
- Would we be comfortable owning it if markets were closed for years?
- Would we accept this outcome without the ability to sell?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Long-term cash flow expectations
- Business durability assessment

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record affirming or rejecting ownership comfort

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Liquidity illusion
- Exit-dependent theses

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Comfort depends on a future sale or repricing

---

### Checkpoint 2: Cash vs Quote Priority Review
**Purpose:**  
Ensure cash economics dominate price considerations.

**Key Questions:**
- What cash does the business generate for owners?
- How is that cash reinvested or distributed?
- How sensitive is value to market quotations?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Owner earnings estimates
- Capital allocation history

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record prioritizing cash over price

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Quote obsession
- Short-term performance fixation

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Decision relies on anticipated price movements

---

### Checkpoint 3: Stewardship Duration Assessment
**Purpose:**  
Evaluate whether the decision aligns with long-term stewardship.

**Key Questions:**
- What responsibilities come with ownership?
- Are we prepared for long periods of underperformance?
- Would this still be acceptable after five or ten years?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Long-term business outlook
- Stress and stagnation scenarios

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record assessing stewardship readiness

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Implicit trading mentality
- Time inconsistency

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Thesis requires frequent reassessment or exit flexibility

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority; ownership framing is judgment-heavy.
- **Models:** Advisory only; may reframe scenarios as ownership cases.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not substitute ownership judgment.

This skill may override otherwise attractive short-term opportunities.

---

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: Indefinite
- Secondary horizon: Multi-decade stewardship

Owner mindset should remain stable across market cycles.

This skill ensures we reason like owners even when markets are open.
