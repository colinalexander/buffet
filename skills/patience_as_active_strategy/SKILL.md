# SKILL: Patience as an Active Strategy

## Summary
Patience as an Active Strategy is the skill of deliberately choosing inaction when
conditions are not favorable, recognizing that waiting can preserve optionality,
improve outcomes, and reduce risk. It treats patience not as passivity, but as a
strategic deployment of time.

This skill ensures that action is taken only when it is justified by value, not
by pressure.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **timing and restraint control**.

It determines whether the optimal decision is to act now, act later, or not act
at all, and protects the system from forcing decisions prematurely.

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Action Necessity Test
**Purpose:**  
Determine whether action is required at this moment.

**Key Questions:**
- What happens if no action is taken?
- Is there a cost to waiting?
- Is urgency intrinsic or perceived?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Time sensitivity analysis
- Opportunity decay assessment

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record affirming action or deliberate inaction

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Artificial urgency
- Action bias

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Action justified primarily by discomfort with waiting

---

### Checkpoint 2: Optionality Preservation Review
**Purpose:**  
Ensure that waiting preserves or enhances future choices.

**Key Questions:**
- Does waiting improve information quality?
- Does waiting improve pricing or terms?
- Does waiting preserve flexibility?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Information arrival expectations
- Market or situational optionality analysis

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record evaluating optionality effects

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Premature commitment
- Optionality destruction

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Waiting materially degrades future opportunity

---

### Checkpoint 3: Patience Payoff Validation
**Purpose:**  
Confirm that patience is likely to be rewarded structurally.

**Key Questions:**
- Who is being pressured to act, and why?
- Does time favor disciplined capital?
- Are others forced sellers or buyers?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Market structure context
- Counterparty incentives

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record validating patience advantage

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Mistaking stagnation for patience
- Waiting without advantage

**Escalation Criteria:**
- No structural benefit to waiting exists

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority to choose inaction.
- **Models:** Advisory only; may surface timing considerations.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not force action to meet activity targets.

This skill may delay otherwise acceptable decisions.

---

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: Variable
- Secondary horizon: Market and information cycles

Patience judgments should be revisited periodically, not continuously.

## Common Misuse Patterns
- Confusing indecision with patience
- Waiting without a clear advantage
- Avoiding accountability through delay

The ability to wait is a competitive advantage.
This skill ensures it is exercised deliberately and defensibly.
