# SKILL: Scale-Aware Decision Making

## Summary
Scale-Aware Decision Making is the skill of recognizing how the size of capital,
organizations, and positions alters opportunity sets, return potential, and risk.
It treats scale not as a virtue, but as a constraint that changes what is possible
and what is prudent.

This skill ensures that decisions remain valid as capital grows.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **capacity and feasibility constraint**.

It evaluates whether a decision that works at one scale remains viable, repeatable,
and value-creating at the system’s current and future size.

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Capacity Constraint Identification
**Purpose:**  
Identify limits imposed by scale on opportunity and execution.

**Key Questions:**
- How does size constrain available opportunities?
- Does this opportunity scale without degrading returns?
- What breaks as capital grows?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Position size vs market capacity analysis
- Liquidity and market depth considerations

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record describing scale constraints

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Extrapolating small-scale success
- Ignoring liquidity limits

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Opportunity does not scale to required size

---

### Checkpoint 2: Return Dilution Assessment
**Purpose:**  
Assess whether increasing scale dilutes incremental returns.

**Key Questions:**
- Are marginal returns declining with size?
- Does scale force compromise on quality or price?
- Is the edge self-limiting?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Historical return vs scale analysis
- Evidence of diminishing marginal returns

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record evaluating return dilution risk

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Size inertia
- Chasing deployability over quality

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Incremental capital materially lowers expected returns

---

### Checkpoint 3: Operational and Governance Stress Review
**Purpose:**  
Ensure scale does not overwhelm systems or governance.

**Key Questions:**
- Does scale introduce operational fragility?
- Are controls, oversight, and processes adequate?
- Does decision latency increase with size?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Operational capacity assessment
- Governance and control structures

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record assessing scale-induced stress

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Organizational brittleness
- Loss of decision quality

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Scale exceeds governance or operational capacity

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority; contextual and forward-looking.
- **Models:** Advisory only; may analyze capacity and liquidity.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not extrapolate scale feasibility autonomously.

This skill may constrain position sizing and opportunity selection.

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: Capital growth trajectory
- Secondary horizon: Market structure evolution

Scale assessments must be revisited as capital grows.

---

## Auditability & Records
- Scale assumptions documented
- Capacity limits recorded and monitored
- Reassessed upon capital growth
- Records retained permanently

---

## Common Misuse Patterns
- Assuming success scales linearly
- Treating size as an advantage by default
- Ignoring liquidity under stress

## Notes
What works brilliantly at small scale can fail quietly at large scale.
This skill ensures size is treated as a constraint, not an entitlement.
