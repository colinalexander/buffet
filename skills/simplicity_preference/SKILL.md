# SKILL: Simplicity Preference

## Summary
Simplicity Preference is the skill of favoring businesses, structures, and decisions
that are understandable, explainable, and monitorable over those that rely on
complexity. It treats unnecessary complexity as a source of hidden risk rather than
sophistication.

This skill enforces clarity as a form of risk control.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **complexity-limiting constraint**.

It ensures that complexity is incurred only when it is unavoidable and explicitly
compensated, and that decisions remain within the system’s governance capacity.

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Complexity Necessity Test
**Purpose:**  
Determine whether complexity is essential or optional.

**Key Questions:**
- Why is this complex?
- What breaks if complexity is removed?
- Is complexity adding return or obscuring risk?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Description of complex elements
- Justification for their necessity

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record affirming or rejecting complexity necessity

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Complexity for appearance
- Overengineering

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Complexity exists without clear justification

---

### Checkpoint 2: Explainability Threshold
**Purpose:**  
Ensure the decision can be explained clearly to informed stakeholders.

**Key Questions:**
- Can this be explained without jargon?
- Would an informed owner understand the risks?
- Can rationale be summarized concisely?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Plain-language explanation
- Stakeholder communication drafts

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record affirming explainability

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Obfuscation
- Expert dependency

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Decision cannot be explained simply

---

### Checkpoint 3: Monitoring Burden Assessment
**Purpose:**  
Ensure complexity does not exceed monitoring and governance capacity.

**Key Questions:**
- What must be monitored continuously?
- Are monitoring signals reliable?
- What happens if monitoring fails?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Monitoring requirements
- Governance resource assessment

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record evaluating monitoring burden

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Blind spots
- Governance overload

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Monitoring exceeds institutional capacity

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority to approve complexity.
- **Models:** Advisory only; may flag complexity and summarize dependencies.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not approve complexity independently.

This skill may veto opportunities even with attractive economics.

---

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: Entire holding period
- Secondary horizon: Governance review cycles

Complexity should decrease, not increase, over time.

## Auditability & Records
- Complexity justifications recorded
- Monitoring plans documented
- Periodic complexity audits conducted
- Records retained permanently

---

## Common Misuse Patterns
- Confusing complexity with edge
- Delegating understanding to specialists
- Allowing systems to become opaque over time
