# SKILL: Structural Advantage Identification

## Summary
Structural Advantage Identification is the skill of recognizing durable advantages
that arise from the structure of a business, industry, or environment rather than
from exceptional execution alone. It distinguishes advantages that persist
automatically from those that require continual effort to maintain.

This skill isolates sources of durability that survive management change,
competition, and time.

---

## Judgment Role
This skill functions as a **durability verification layer**.

It determines whether a business’s favorable economics are protected by structural
forces or depend primarily on continued excellence, favorable conditions, or
behavioral edge.

## Judgment Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Advantage Source Classification
**Purpose:**  
Identify and classify the origin of any claimed advantage.

**Key Questions:**
- Is the advantage structural, contractual, regulatory, network-based, or behavioral?
- Which elements persist without active defense?
- Which elements decay naturally over time?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Industry structure analysis
- Contractual, regulatory, or network characteristics

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record classifying advantage sources

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Conflating execution quality with structural advantage
- Over-attributing advantage to brand or culture

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Advantage depends primarily on continued exceptional behavior

---

### Checkpoint 2: Replicability and Erosion Assessment
**Purpose:**  
Assess how easily competitors can replicate or erode the advantage.

**Key Questions:**
- What would a capable competitor need to do to replicate this?
- What barriers prevent replication?
- How has erosion occurred historically?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Competitive response analysis
- Historical erosion examples

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record evaluating erosion risk

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Underestimating competitor adaptability
- Ignoring technological or regulatory shifts

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Advantage is easily replicated or already eroding

---

### Checkpoint 3: Advantage Longevity Projection
**Purpose:**  
Estimate how long the advantage is likely to persist.

**Key Questions:**
- What forces reinforce the advantage over time?
- What forces weaken it?
- Is decay gradual or discontinuous?

**Required Evidence / Inputs:**
- Long-term industry trends
- Structural reinforcement mechanisms

**Expected Outputs:**
- Judgment Record projecting advantage longevity

**Failure Modes Guarded Against:**
- Assuming permanence without cause
- Ignoring slow-moving threats

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Advantage longevity is highly uncertain or short-lived

---

## Authority Boundaries
- **Humans:** Full authority to classify and judge durability.
- **Models:** Advisory only; may surface structural features and comparisons.
- **Prohibited:** Models may not certify moat durability independently.

This skill informs but does not replace business quality assessment.

---

## Time Horizon
- Primary horizon: 10–30 years
- Secondary horizon: Industry evolution cycles

Structural advantages should degrade slowly and predictably.

- long_horizon_compounding_orientation

---

## Auditability & Records
- Advantage classifications documented explicitly
- Erosion indicators monitored
- Reassessed upon structural change
- Records retained permanently

---

## Common Misuse Patterns
- Labeling temporary success as a moat
- Ignoring regulation or technology as erosion forces
- Overconfidence in brand strength alone

## Notes
True structural advantages persist even when no one is trying especially hard.
If constant defense is required, the advantage is likely behavioral, not structural.
